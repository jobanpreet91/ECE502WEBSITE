<h1>Adult–Child Interactions and Home Learning Environments</h1>

<p>
Positive adult–child interactions play a key role in supporting language development.
Children learn language best through warm, responsive, and meaningful communication.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Talking with children during daily routines</li>
  <li>Reading books together</li>
  <li>Singing songs and nursery rhymes</li>
  <li>Asking open-ended questions</li>
  <li>Listening and responding to children’s ideas</li>
</ul>

<p>
Home learning environments that are rich in language help children develop confidence, curiosity,
and strong communication skills.
