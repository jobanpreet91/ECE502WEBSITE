<h1>Cultural and Linguistic Responsiveness</h1>

<p>
Children grow up in families with diverse languages, cultures, and traditions. Cultural and linguistic
diversity should be respected and celebrated in children’s learning environments.
</p>

<p>
Families are encouraged to continue using their home language with their children. Speaking more than one
language supports children’s identity and does not delay English language development.
</p>

<p>
Songs, stories, cultural celebrations, and everyday conversations help children feel a sense of belonging
and confidence. Valuing children’s culture and language supports positive communication and learning.
