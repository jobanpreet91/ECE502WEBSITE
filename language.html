<h1>What Is Language Development?</h1>

<p>
Language development refers to how children learn to understand and use language to communicate with others.
This includes listening, understanding words, speaking, and using language to express thoughts, needs,
and feelings.
</p>

<p>
Children begin developing language from birth through interactions with adults and their environment.
Talking, listening, reading, singing, and playing all support language development.
</p>

<p>
Language development is closely connected to children’s thinking, social relationships, and emotional wellbeing.
Every child develops language at their own pace, and supportive environments help children feel confident to communicate.
